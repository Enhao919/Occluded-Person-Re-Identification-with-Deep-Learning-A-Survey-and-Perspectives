# Occluded-Person-Re-Identification-with-Deep-Learning-A-Survey-and-Perspectives
Person re-identification (Re-ID) technology is playing an increasingly important role in intelligent surveillance systems. Widespread occlusion is a vital factor that affects the performance of person Re-ID. Occluded person Re-ID is a pedestrian matching method under conditions such as pedestrian information loss, noise interference, and perspective misalignment, and it has attracted extensive attention from researchers. In recent years, many occlusion-solving person Re-ID methods have been proposed. These methods solve one or more sub-problems under occlusion from different angles. However, few studies have conducted a comprehensive, detailed comparison and summary and evaluated the prospects of occluded person Re-ID methods. 
In this review, We begin with a comprehensive description of the dataset and evaluation scheme for the occluded person Re-ID.
Then, existing deep learning-based occluded person Re-ID methods are scientifically classified, analysed from different perspectives and concisely summarised.
Finally, these methods are systematically compared, the state-of-the-art methods are identified, and an outlook on the future development of occluded person Re-ID is provided.
